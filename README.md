# Project Clone and Local Run Instructions  
To clone and run a project locally, begin by accessing the project's GitHub repository and locating the clone URL. Using Git in your terminal or command prompt, execute the git clone command followed by the repository URL to download the project files to your local machine. Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the project directory using the cd command.

Before running the project, ensure all necessary dependencies are installed. This typically involves using package managers like npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn. Check the project's README file for specific instructions on installing dependencies. Additionally, review any .env files provided to set up environment variables such as API keys or database connection strings.

After configuring dependencies and environment variables, start the project by running the appropriate command in your terminal. Common commands include npm start or yarn start to launch a development server. Once the server is running, open your web browser and enter the local host address specified in the project's documentation (often http://localhost:3000).
